# "Simulate and Recover"
This repository contains code for my COGS 106 class final project.

## Overview of the EZ Diffusion Model ##
The EZ Diffusion Model is a cognitive model that allows us to compute estimated parameters directly from observed summary statistics. These parameters have of psychological meaning behind them, and the model is used to analyze data collected from decision making experiments.

## Directory Organization ##
- /src: contains main simulation script and parameter recovery script
- /test: contains unit tests for the scripts in /src
- /results: stores the csv output file from running the simulation script
